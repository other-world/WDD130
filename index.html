                <p>Hello, I'm Jamie. I just finished the basic BYU Pathways courses and I'm starting at BYU-I, seeking a degree in Computer Science and Web Development. I studied CS and Information Technology at BYU-Provo, but never graduated. I know enough about computers to be successful in the job market. But the market is changing fast and I want a degree to help strength my weaknesses. </p>
                <p>I love most things involving the outdoors and nature. I keep houseplants indoors and a wild garden outdoors. I keep a little homestead with chickens and rabbits. I also have two dogs. I love hiking, rock climbing, and especially canyoneering.</p>
                <p>CSS has been a serious weak spot for me in web development. I'm hoping to becoming much more comfortable with it during this course. Especially when it comes to positioning elements of a web page. </p>

                <p>The State of Utah contains some of the most beautiful desert scenery in the world. The image above is taken in a particularly remote location. It's an arch hidden in a canyon called, Hogwarts. It can only be reached by rapelling down several cliffs, including one that runs down and through this arch. Canyoneering is one of my favorite activites. It requires careful planning, technical outdoors skills, and lots of teamwork.</p>
