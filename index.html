            <p>Hello, I'm Jamie. I just finished the basic BYU Pathways courses and I'm starting at BYU-I, seeking a degree in Computer Science and Web Development. I studied CS and Information Technology at BYU Provo, but never graduated. But I know enough about computers to be successful in the job market. It's changing fast and I want a degree to help strength my weaknesses. </p>
            <p>I love most things involving the outdoors and nature. I keep houseplants indoors and a wild garden outdoors. I also keep a little homestead with chickens and rabbits. I also have two dogs. I love hiking, rock climbing, and especially canyoneering.</p>
